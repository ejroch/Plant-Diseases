Introduction to Deep Learning Final Project - Classification of Plant Diseases

All related project files are located in this repository including the dataset PlantVillage. Mind you the file size is roughly 900 MB because of the nature of there being 50,000 images located in the dataset. 

That being said there are quite a few dependencies/libraries in the jupyter notebook itself. The notebookshould be able to be pulled and run with little to no problems, however, the training process for image training can be an extensive one if you are not leveraging a powerful GPU. Based off of the CPU training for one model could take upwards of 10 hours, so given that be sure that you are using a capable system if you decide to run the training portion of the jupyter notebook.
